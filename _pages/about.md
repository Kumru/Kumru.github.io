I am a final-year Ph.D. student, supervised by [Emre Ã–zkan](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/emreo/) in the [Sensor Fusion Laboratory](http://sensorfusion.eee.metu.edu.tr/).
I am currently a research and teaching assistant with the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University (METU).
I previously received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from METU in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

My research mainly focuses on developing probabilistic models and inference methods to realize more effective and reliable perception systems for autonomous machines.

I am particularly interested in applying probabilistic machine learning methods to object tracking, SLAM, and system identification problems.
